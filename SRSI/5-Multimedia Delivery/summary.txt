Multimedia delivery:

Multimedia = multiple media (e.g audio+video)

Flow: A/D -> coding -> packetisation -> network -> packet buffer -> decoding -> playout buffer -> d/a -> render;

Audio coding: 
- Temporal redundancy (PCM)
- Perceptual redundancy (some sounds are more perceived than others, MPEG)
- Low bandwidth:
    Voice activity detector;
    Discontinuous transmission;

Image Redundancy: 
- Spectral - colour components;
- Spatial - redundancy in adjacent pixels;     
Video Redundancy:
- The above and added temporal - redundancy in adjacent frames

MPEG Coding: consecutive images contain similar information, MPEG uses temporal redundancy, either intra-picture, predicted frame, or interpolation between previous and next frames;

Predictive encoding: Takes into account motion vectors relative to previous and next frame, and extrapolates the difference from reference frames. 

GOP - Group of Pictures.

Large GOP - high compression, errors take more time to be corrected (resync);
Small GOP - less compression, errors corrected more quickly, but higher bandwidth;

Errors in a frame produce errors in dependent frames (error propagation)

Requirements:
- Delay dependencies between sender and receiver;
- Requirements depende on type of media;
- Interactivity with stream source;
- Source and receiver must be able to adapt to application-specific details;

Multimedia Support:
- Multimedia traffic:
    Highly variable traffic characteristics and QoS requirements;
    Strict timing requirements;
    Traffic requires specific agreement between sender and receiver;
- Network:
    Varying throughput;
    No guarantees;
    Delay variations;
    Traffic agnostic; 
    Basically, it fluctuates a lot.

Playout buffer:
- Buffer on the receiver side, frames are stored to be played;
- Application waits for a certain number of frames (threshold) before playing -> playout delay
- Decoder reads from buffer 
    Frame to be played must have already arrived

Real Time Protocol (RTP):
- Allows end-to-end streaming to multiple clients;
- Supports several media formats and transport protocols;
- Out-of-band signalling;
- Provides timestaming for the playout buffer;
- Provides sequence numbers (identify losses, re-order packets)
- Identifies source of transported media streams;
- Enables multiplexing different content;

RTP Control Plane (RTCP):
- Synchronization of different media;
- Inform of network issues;
- Negotiate media specific characteristics (coding, compression and whatnot)
- Provides feedback receiver quality and means for an adaptation, flow control and adaptive media coding;
- Uses periodic feedback to all members of an RTP session on statistics, faults, and properties;


RTP Entities:
- Transport Address;
- RTP Media Type, session, multimedia session;
- Synchronization source;
- Contribution source;

RTP Mixer: 
- Intermediate stream receives and combines RTP packets from different sources;
- Establishes synchronization relationship between mixed streams;
- Resulting stream goes to a new multicast address;

RTP Translator: 
- Different participants in a multimedia session may use different data standards;
- Intermediate system that does not change synchronization source;

RTP Media Profiles:
- How a header field is interpreted depends on the media profile;
- Payload type identifies format and interpretation of payload; 

(mais coisas aqui, mas porra estes slides são muito maus)

Basically RTP is the protocol, RTCP is for the QoS.

RTCP Packets, Sender and Receiver reports;

RTCP performance issues arise when the amount of reports can either flood the network and consume too
much bandwidth, or not enough of them are done, and therefore there is a low reaction capability.

Session signalling:
- Serves to manage connections, negotiate features or settings, and reserve resources;

RTSP - Realtime Streaming Protocol (Multimedia Signalling protocol)
It's a network remote control for multimedia servers.

RTSP Features in the slides, christ I wanna get this over with;

Interplay with RTP;
SIP is for calls and things like that;
