CDN -> Content Delivery Network

Caching is storing the contents with high number of hits in locations where they can be more efficiently downloaded. This way they can be better accessed.

Cache hit -> retrieve local copy of page;
Cache miss -> retrieve page from server;

Advantages:
- Less requests
- Less full responses
- Improved performance due to better response times
- Higher availability due to lower server and network load 


Disadvantages:
- Possibly stale data 

Challenges:
- How to cache? Pre-fetch and on-demand
- How long to cache? Based on expiration timestamp
- Requires fast search methods, and large amounts of space
- Where to cache? Three alternatives: 
    At the client:
        If a page is accessed frequently, it should be cached in the client, to avoid retrieving the page.
    Near the client: 
        Reduces traffic to distant servers, and reduces the response time due to physical proximity.
    At or near the server: 
	Reduces
