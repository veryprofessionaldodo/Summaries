Congestion control in best-effort networks:

IP networks try to provided as many packets as possible, and higher layers handle flows;
Queueing and scheduling do not prevent congestion, that is handled end-to-end;

Dealing with congestion is avoidance, detecting and reacting to it:
- Hosts predict congestion based on RTT observation or routers actively signal expected congestion;

Congestion control aims to use the available bandwidth without causing buffer overflow at the routers and distributing load;

Flow control is avoiding overloading receiver, congestion is avoiding overloading network;

Window size is calculated taking into consideration the congestion control window (cwindow);

That window is increased or decreased according to the perceived level of congestion by the endpoint;

That perception is based on packets that are not delivered (assumes they were lost due to congestion);

Recall Method:
- When a packet is successful, increase the congestion window, if not decrease it;
- Decrease faster than increase;

Inferring packet losses:
- Retransmission timeout;
- Duplicate Acknowledgments;

Fast Retransmit / Fast Recovery:
- Sender acknowledges packet loss as the receiver emitting repeating ACK;
- After 3 repeated ACKS, the sender retransmits the missing packet;

Slow start prevents the initial burst of packets to the network, by increasing the congestion window size with each acknowledged packet sent;

Active Queue Management: 
- Detect congestion in advance, and inform hosts to reduce send rate; 
- Can also involve routers;

DECBit:
- Sets a bit in a header to let the host know about congestion, and then the host sends that to the sender;
- Processing at routers needs to be simple, setting a bit is simple;

Random Early Detection (RED):
- Routers drop packets to inform the source before congestion happens;
- Since the routers drop packets randomly, the more bandwidth the higher the chance to drop packets;

Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN):
- Similar to RED, but packet isn't dropped, only congestion bit is set. When the receiver emits an ACK, the sender behaves as if the packet was dropped;

Quality of Service:

Resource allocation allows the sharing of resources;
