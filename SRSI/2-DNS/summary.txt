DNS

Names identify resources, and addresses identify locations of resources; 
DNS is a network service, that converts the name of a website to an IP address;
Names are more transparent and convenient than addresses;

Binding: association between name and resource attributes;
Name space: collection of all names recognized by a specific service;
Name scope: part of system within which a name binding is valid;
Naming domain: name space for which there is only one administrative authority and one binding;
Resolution mechanism: returns attributes when given a name (uses binding probably);

Name Resolution:
- Iterative: Client goes through all name servers;
- Recursive: Clients asks in one name server, name server asks all name servers;

Domain Name System (DNS) requirements (FRASM):
- Freshness
- Reliability
- Availability
- Scalability
- Manageable by distributed entities

Has an hierarchical namespace, and each namespace is managed by an authority.

A domain must have an authoritative server to know the names in the zone. It delegates the response for other servers, that are responsible for the answer.

Basically this allows for a hierarchical organization, where the client asks the first authoritative server, who might not have the IP, but knows who does. The client asks again to this new server, who might not have the IP, but knows who does, so on until it reaches the server with the IP. 

DNS Resolution:
- Lookup queries (who has the IP for the name x?);
- Bootstrap, local name server is configurable and root servers are known out-of-band (outside the zone);
- Caching;
- Uses UDP;
