Iphone:
- Appeared in 2007;
- Muiti-touch display with gesture recognition;
- Sensors, camera, wireless communications;

iOS derives from UNIX;

iOS provides the APIs for the developer to use, serving as a bridge between the hardware and software;

iOS API Layer:
- Cocoa Touch: used to handle input events, access tp sensors, camera, etc;
- Media: everything graphics, audio and video;
- Core Services: collections, data and time, application bundle, and other things, such as SQLite, security certificates, and XML stuff;
- Core OS: threads, networking, files, etc.

Apps use MVC (Model-View-Controller):
- Model has objects and their state, Controller takes care of event loop, and feeds information to the View. 

ViewController:
- IBOutlet represents an object in the interface builder;
- IBAction are handlers of events generated in interface objects;
