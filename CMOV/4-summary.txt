Activities define full screen interface, but with a larger screen real estate (like tablets), it becomes useful to have fragments, which are basically sub-activities.

Fragments:
- Have their own layout (have a <fragment> tag);
- Have their own lifecycle;
- Are used inside an activity, using the same thread and context;
- But can respond to the back button;

Lifecycle:
- Starting -> Created -> Active -> Inactive -> Destroyed
                                            -> Created

Lifecycle callbacks:
- onInflate(Activity, AttributeSet, Bundle): Called when the activity sets its content layout and a fragment is in it. AttributeSet
