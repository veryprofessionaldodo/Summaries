Sensors: 
- Location:
    Lat and long, altitude, accuracy;
    Obtained from GPS (accurate, but expensive) or derived from Wi-fi access points or mobile communication towers (less accurate, but less expensive);
    Accessible through GPS_PROVIDER, NETWORK_PROVIDER or PASSIVE_PROVIDER (another app);
    App must declare ACCESS_COURSE_LOCATION and/or ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION in the Manifest;
- Movement (speed): TYPE_ACCELEROMETER, TYPE_GYROSCOPE;
- Orientation: TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD;
- Environment TYPE_AMBIENTE_TEMPERATURE, TYPE_LIGHT, ...PRESSURE, ...PROXIMITY, ...RELATIVE_HUMIDITY;

Location Classes:
- LocationListener: listens to location events, like location changing, provider being disabled or enabled...
- LocationManager: a service for requesting locations and selecting a provider, accessible through Context.LOCATION_SERVICE. Can request updates periodically based on distance or time, but should only request them if the activity is in the foreground;
- Locations: delivered to LocationListener, with latitude, longitude, time and provider, and more information;

Sensors can be physical (give actual measurements) or synthesized (process measurements to calculate another quantity).
Synthesized sensors are TYPE_GRAVITY, ...LINEAR_ACCELERATION, ...ORIENTATION, ...ROTATION_VECTOR, ...SIGNIFICANT_MOTION.

To get all sensors, use TYPE_ALL.

Sensors have a range and resolution, rate of measurement and power consumption.

Sensor Classes:
- SensorManager: service accessible through Context.SENSOR_SERVICE, knows all sensors, registers SensorEventListener;
- SensorEventLisnter or TriggerEventListener: Interfaces that respond to sensor measurements;
- SensorEvent: a measurement;

Noise Processing:
- Some sensors produce noise, use filters (low pass, higt pass, band pass, Kalman filters).
