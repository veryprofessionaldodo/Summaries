Soft Keyboards:
- Most devices don't have keyboards;
- Soft keyboards are controlled by the input method editor;

Many input types on EditText determine the keyboard (numeric, date, email...);

Images are drawn to the screen using the Activity View, with the 'onDraw(Canvas)' method.

Canvas defines primitives, with an instance of Paint. Geometric instances are defined using a Path (use them with 'canvas.drawPath()'). 

Full custom views can be created, but need to override several methods from the View class, like the 'onMeasure()' or the 'onDraw()'.

MediaPlayer class can play audio, asynchronously, and supports a lot of media formats. 

VideoView encapsulates a video to be played in an activity, supports MP4, 3GP and AVC. Set video path with, well, 'setVideoPath()'. Start with the aptly named 'start()' method.

Preview Camera in Activity:
- Add SurfaceView to Activity layout;
- Get SurfaceHolder from SurfaceView;
- Add SurfaceHolder.callback object to SurfaceHolder;
- In the 'surfaceChanged()' callback, 'setPreviwDisplay()' and configure camera;
- 'startPreview()' and when stopped, 'stopPreview()' and 'release()';

OpenGL:
- Library for 3D graphics, OpenGL ES used for mobile;
- To use OpenGL, use with 'setContentView()' a GLSurfaceView, that creates a GLRenderer;

Many types of touch events, so they are abstraced into click, long click, etc.

To interecept all input use with 'setOnTouchListener()' a OnTouchListener. It intercepts MotionEvent objects, with a specific action like and properties of the touch (like position);

GestureDetector detects and trigger one finger gestures, whereas ScaleGestureDetector detects the pinch two finger gesture.
