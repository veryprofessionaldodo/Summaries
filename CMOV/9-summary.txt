Broadcast receivers were mentioned in summary #2, can be declared by the <receiver> tag.

Services, extra information:
- If service not in memory started with 'onCreate()';
- Any client can start service asynchronously, with 'startService()' which calls 'onStartCommand()', and terminate it with 'stopService()', which calls 'onDestroy()', or the service kills itself with 'stopSelf()'. Tragic, really;
- Services are freed when stopped, or Android needs the memory. In this case, services can be brought to memory again;
- Can also be created with by a connection (bind);

IntentService is a special Service subclass that creates a worker thread;

Remote call services:
- Invoked using RPC (Remote Procedure Call);
- Standalone in their own processes;
- Activated (brought to memory and invoked) through 'bindService()' and freed when last client calls 'unbindService()';
- 'onServiceConnected()' tells when a service is ready to be called, and 'onServiceDisconnected()' tells that it's not available;

Notifications:
- Appear on the status bar;
- Extended status drawer for more information;
- Notifications are a system service, called Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE;
- Access that service with a NotificationManager;
- Customize notifications by using a Notification.Builder(), and then specifying the characteristics like icons, text, things like that;

Alarms are another service, accessible through Context.ALARM_SERVICE, and then modifying it using a AlarmManager. Can be repeating with 'setRepeating()';
