White-box:

Adequacy of the test suite is if it satisfies a certain criterion.

An element of the coverage is infeasible if it cannot be covered by any test.

White-box testing is generation of test cases with knowledge of source.

Coverage: 
- Statement coverage: execute every statement of program;
- Branch coverage: go through all the branches of decisions;
- Decision coverage: every decision has taken all possible outcomes;
- Condition coverage: every condition in a decision has taken all possible outcomes;
- Modified condition/decision coverage: every condition in a decision has been shown to independently affect that decision's outcome (basically make the two variables equal, then change one of them; if the outcome varies, then it satisfies the mc/dc criteria);
- Multiple condition coverage: test each combination of conditions (exponential blow-up);
- Path coverage: execute every posible path, usually impossible;
- Independent path or basis path coverage: maximal set of linearly independent paths;

Data flow testing: checks the variable whenever it is referenced. Can help detect unused variables, undefined variables, undeclared, things like that.

Start with black-box, go then to white-box testing.
