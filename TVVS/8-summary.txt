Model Based Testing:
- Tests are derived from the model of the System;
- Uses model program that acts an oracle (authority that tells if a test passes or not);

Advanatages: 
- Better quality of product (duh);
- Can adapt to changes;

Disadvantages:
- Requires a formal specification;
- Test case explosion;

MBT Phases:
- Modeling:
    Design the model;
    Needs to be accurate;
    Can be deterministic or not, timed or not, discrete, hybrid or continuous;
- Test Generation:
    Needs to choose input values and generate sequence of operation calls;
    Careful with combinatorial explosion;
    Constructs Control Flow Graph, and then selects a path to construct test data;
    Or it can be random:
    Intelligent Test Data is tests coupled with a detailed analysis of the code;
    Generating input can be done by combination strategies (deterministic or not, instant or iterative);
    Generating sequence of operation calls can be done with navigation through an FSM, create a state space;
    Make sure tests are adequate by measuring accuracy, and other coverage criteria;
    Transform abstract test cases into concrete;
- Test Execution:
    Results can be extracted after each run, or stored in memory to be later compared as a batch, or even it can generate tests antd then run them;

Analyse manually faults detected, can be in the code or in the model (normally 50/50).
