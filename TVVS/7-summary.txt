Static testing:

Reviews: 
- Cost effective
- Prevent failures by reducing faults;
- Better suited for finding deviations from requirements and things like that (things dynamic testing can't detect);
- Anything written can be reviewed;

Phases of review:
- Planning;
- Kick-off (explaining and shit);
- Individual preparation;
- Review Meeting (discussion about defects);
- Rework (fix errors);
- Follow-up (check that defects have been fixed);

Deliverables are changes in review products. 

Roles: 
- Manager (decides when to do reviews and if they were useful);
- Moderator (leads review and planninbb)
- Author: writer or person with responsibility for the documents to be reviewed;
- Reviewers;
- Scribe;

Can be informal or technical;

Review is successful when defects found are welcome, is positive for the author and things like that.

Static analysis: 
- Run without executing the code;
- Improves maintainability;
- Finds defects;
- Tool-based;
- Finds unreachable code, unused variables and things like that.
- Uses data flow analysis;

Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the complexity of a flow graph.
