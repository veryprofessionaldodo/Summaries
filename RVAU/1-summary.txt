-Intro to VR:

Ivan Sutherland was the pioneer with the first interactive graphics program;

In 1959, computers were expensive, and not a lot of them were around;

Form factors kept decreasing throught the years;

Interfaces:
- GUIs (clear separation between physical and digital);
- Ubiquitous computing / IoT (computing is done in the devices)
- VR (3D generated environment with Head Mount Display HMD, gloves and whatnot)
    Definition of VR is: an artificial world created by a computer, affected by the user

    Characteristics of VR: 
        - 3D Stereoscopic Display
        - Wide Field of View;
        - Low latency head tracking;

    Presence - the sense of being in the environment;
    Telepresense - sensation of being elsewhere created by a set of technologies

    AIP Cube:
        - Autonomy (can react to events);
        - Interaction (self-explanatory);
        - Presence (immersion like raid shadow legends);
- AR (Virtual images blended with the real world, used with screens, see-through HMDs);
    Characteristics of AR:
        - Combines real and virtual images;
        - Interactive in real-time;
        - 3D (objects are in a fixed space)

TL;DR 
VR replaces reality, AR enhances IoT
VR needs realism, AR does not
VR needs immersive device, AR does not

History of VR:

30,000 BC - Paintings and shit;
1800s - Panoramas, photography, movies;
1900s - Early simulators and HMDs (the first HMD had no CG, but they eventually had them)
1967-80s - Haptic and Force Feedback Systems  
1979 - LEEP (Large Expanse, Extra Perspectivce) Optics, had high center resolution, lower resolution in periphery; 
1981-82 - Data Glove (a glove with sensors I guess)
1981-86 - NASA Virtual Interface Environment Workstation (VIEW)
1985-1999 - Commercial era, first companies arise;
1992 - CAVE (3D room environment, viewpoint tracking)
2010-now - VR Second Wave (Oculus Rift, Index HALF LIFE ALYX)
