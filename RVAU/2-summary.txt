Perception and Presence:

Presence - the feeling of being in another place;
Immersion - vivid illusion of reality;

Creating Strong Presence:
- Use multiple senses;
- Include agents that interact with the user;
- Have environments respond to user;

What influences presence:
- vividness;
- vivid body;
- internal factors;
- interactivity;
- sensory;

Levels of Immersion:
- Challenge-induced immersion: staying in the "flow" state, where there is a balance between challenges and abilites;
- System and perceptual response: capability of reproducing natural perception through multisensory displays;
- Narrative: immersion in the world and story being told;

We perceive reality through sensation (gathering information) and perception (interpreting information).

Illusion of reality is created by generating sights, sounds, etc to fool the silly human.

Physiology of Visual Perception (8 things, Eye field stereo, move time space res, visual space color):
1. Human Eye;
2. Field of vision;
3. Stereoscopy;
4. Visual Perception of movement;
5. Temporal Resolution;
6. Spatial Resolution;
7. Visual Perception of space;
8. Color Perception;

The human eye (CGRA 2 DASSE)
- Converts eletromagnetic radiation to nerve impulses;
- High sensitivity to slight light variations;
- Adapts to light;

Field of vision:
- Masks and goggles decrease FOV;
- FOV of HMD is lower than EYEs;

Stereoscopy:
- Binocular vision is when both eyes can see a thing;
- Two channels, one sensory system;
- Allows depth perception;
- Binocular Rivalry Efect (when the two images don't match) can cause failure to focus;
