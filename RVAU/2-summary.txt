Perception and Presence:

Presence - the feeling of being in another place;
Immersion - vivid illusion of reality;

Creating Strong Presence:
- Use multiple senses;
- Include agents that interact with the user;
- Have environments respond to user;

What influences presence:
- vividness;
- vivid body;
- internal factors;
- interactivity;
- sensory;

Levels of Immersion:
- Challenge-induced immersion: staying in the "flow" state, where there is a balance between challenges and abilites;
- System and perceptual response: capability of reproducing natural perception through multisensory displays;
- Narrative: immersion in the world and story being told;

We perceive reality through sensation (gathering information) and perception (interpreting information).

Illusion of reality is created by generating sights, sounds, etc to fool the silly human.

Physiology of Visual Perception (8 things, Eye field stereo, move time space res, visual space color):
1. Human Eye;
2. Field of vision;
3. Stereoscopy;
4. Visual Perception of movement;
5. Temporal Resolution;
6. Spatial Resolution;
7. Visual Perception of space;
8. Color Perception;

The human eye (CGRA 2 DASSE)
- Converts eletromagnetic radiation to nerve impulses;
- High sensitivity to slight light variations;
- Adapts to light;

Field of vision:
- Masks and goggles decrease FOV;
- FOV of HMD is lower than EYEs;

Stereoscopy:
- Binocular vision is when both eyes can see a thing;
- Two channels, one sensory system;
- Allows depth perception;

Problems:
- Binocular Rivalry Efect (when the two images don't match, or when you can view some things from the "outside world" on an HMD) can cause failure to focus;
- Lateral disparity: when there is an obstruction on the object attempting to be focused by one of the eyes when another object is in direct line of sight of the other eye;
- Binocular disparity: when different sides of an object are seen due to the natural distance between the eyes;
- Misalignment by rotation;
- Different zoom on each image;

Perception of Movement:
- Visual flow cues are not natural (what is straight IRL can be curved in perspective);
- Motion Parallax (relation between objects as they move)

Temporal Resolution:
- Eye Rodes are good for low light, but take a long time to adapt to environment;
- Eye Cones adapt faster;
- Flicker can appear steady at a certain rate, like the wheels of a fast moving car;
- Flicker is influenced by brightness, position on the retina, and FOV;

Spatial Resolution is basically number of pixels that allow differentiation of two objects.

Color Perception:
- Hue, Saturation, Value (CGRA);
- Response can be achromatic (light doesn't disperse into colors), monochromatic (limited range of wavelengths);
- Varies in people;
- Varies according to illumination;

Auditory Perception:
- Location:
    Time differences;
    Intensity differences;
    Echo;
    Accuracy varies according to how continuous sound is and head movement;
- Frequency must be separated, and tone detection varies according to range;

Touch Perception:
- Skin;
- Tact;
- Kinaesthesia (ability to recognize own body);
