Design Guidelines:

Human-centered design focus on the human part of the machine (wow)

General Design: 
- Design for short sitting experiences for binocular displays;
- Minimize things closer to the eyes (vergence-accomodation conflict);
Motion Design: 
- Make the motion of the viewport match the head motion of the user;
- With high latency, design things that do not require fast head motion;
Interaction Design:
- Make things confortable and non-repetitive to avoid strain;

Universal Tasks in VR:
- Pickup and move things;
- Move around the map;
- Change the system state;

Virtual Hand:
- One-to-one mapping between real and virtual hands;
- Only select objects in hand reach;

Selection:
- Many ways to do it, raycast, cone based, whatever;
- What matters is that there's an object indication, a confirmation of selection, and feedback;

Manipulation:
- Place objects, use tools and things like that;
- Can be egocentric (view manipulate model from outside) or exocentric (view and interact with the world);

Manipulation can be enhanced by extending the arm or shrinking the world.

Navigation is wayfinding and travelling (i thonk then i walk)

Several ways to move:
- Steering:
    Gaze-directed steering, pointing based;
- Velocity: 
    Constant, gesture based, selectable;
- Input conditions:
    Constant, continuous, start/stop;

System control (menus, voice commands) needs to be made easy and visible to the user.

Floating Menus in 3D can be occluded by geometry, should follow user.

Interaction Design should answer three questions:
- How do you affect the world?
- What do you sense of the world?
- What do you learn?

Important Questions for VR?
- Who are the users?
- What are the user needs?
    Frame and reframe the problem to solve;
- Can VR address those needs?
    VR is good for 3D interaction, but bad for feedback and non-visual interactions.

Use interfaces similar to what the user is accustomed to. 

Affordances provide strong clues to how things work. Can be real (texture, shape) or virtual (look);

Design for perception in terms of cues for senses, for the human motion range, and for a wide group of users (different characteristic like age, height, familiarity with VR, color perception).

UX Challenges: 
- Keep the user safe;
- Make it look real;
- No simulation sickness pls;
- Easy to use;
