Health Issues:

Latency is the time between starting a movement, and having output of said movement.

Low latency can still cause motion sickness, when visual cues lag behing percetual cues (moving and showing that movement).

If VR is used for training, latencies higher than 120ms render it useless.

After action, brain estimates how the state changed because of it.
Good feedback relies on world changing predictably according to user's actions.

Sickness is caused by:
- Latency;
- Field of View;
- Tracking accuracy problems;
- Refresh Rate
- Vergence accomodation (vergence distance not equal to focal distance);
- Eye Separation (IPD not matching to inter image distance);

Reduce Delay:
- Better Hardware;
- Reduce apparent latency (take tracking measurement just before rendering);
- Predictive tracking (antecipate user movement, can lead to catastrophic errors);

Accelerate Rendering

View-Frustrum Culling:
- Example can be seen here -> https://giphy.com/gifs/linarf-xUPGcgiYkD2EQ8jc5O ;
- Remove polygons outside of clipping volume;
- Bounding Volume Hierarchies classify objects. They are bounding boxes that compartmentalize the object to be rendered (can be spheres, squares, oriented squares, or convex shapes);
. To reduce trees, bonding volumes are organized hierarchically. If a parent node isn't visible in the tree, no sense in checking leaf nodes;
- Spatial Partitioning classify space. It works by dividing spaces into regions:
    Quadtrees, Octrees can be recursively subdivided to take into account content;
    Kd-trees is similar to octree, but doesn't have to split space evenly;
    Similar to Kd-Trees, but can be split with a rotation;

Occlusion Culling:
- Image Space (z-buffer, which is distance to camera, tiling and coverage masks, or occlusion maps);
- Object Space (shadow volume calling, it it is in shadow don't draw);
- Preprocessing (ray casting, which is emitting a ray to see which objects it hits, cell subdivision for games with interior scenes that repeat);
